           ==================================================================

1. Basic aim for my app is to process an RSS feed and then display the data on the phone screen.

2. Under this app i will be downloading data over the internet , run task in the background using the ASYNCTask
   nd parsing xml file to extract data from the downloaded feed.

3. RSS - Rich site summary or Really simple syndication.

   But basically RSS is a way to present web data in a standard format so that the users can subscribe to the
   RSS feed and recieve updates automatically.

   IT itself in general is not a full information ie it generally contains summary.












              will be adding more info in the process of creating this app stay tuned....:)
