           ==================================================================

1. Basic aim for my app is to process an RSS feed and then display the data on the phone screen.

2. Under this app i will be downloading data over the internet , run task in the background using the ASYNCTask
   nd parsing xml file to extract data from the downloaded feed.

3. RSS - Rich site summary or Really simple syndication.

   But basically RSS is a way to present web data in a standard format so that the users can subscribe to the
   RSS feed and recieve updates automatically.

   IT itself in general is not a full information ie it generally contains summary.

   ==============

1. jst started off today with the ASYNCTASK- used to perform the download on the seperate thread and get notified
   when the download is finished.
   so it prevents the freezing in the device.

2. here i am starting with firstly creating a new class for the Asynctask activity but not a new class page
   creating it as a subclass within the main class as it will not be used by anything else.

3. here i am taking the advantage of the asynchronous processing that the android framework provides us with.

   so we jst have to type the code for the implementation rest is all handeled by the android studio.













              will be adding more info in the process of creating this app stay tuned....:)
